Classify handwritten digits using the famous MNIST data
========================================================

This repo will contain R (and maybe Python) code to classify handwritten digits taken from the MNIST data set. 

Data can be downloaded into the `data` directory by cloning this repo and running the shell script:

`sh data_and_benchmarks\get_competition_data.sh`

For the time being, `repo\manuscripts\` contains the technical files documenting this project. They may be phased out later.
